# Stock-Sentiment-Pipeline
A data pipeline to extract stock sentiment data from Reddit ([r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), [r/valueinvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/valueinvesting/), [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/))

Questions This Project Seeks to Answer:
- Which stocks are discussed the most?
- Whats the average sentiment for every stock mentioned (per week)?
- What posts have the most engagement? (Most comments, upvotes)

The output will be displayed as a Google Looker Studio Report

## Motivation
- This project was initiated based on my strong interest in data engineering and the US stock market.
- It gave me a great opportunity to further develop my skillset while working with a diverse range of data engineering tools. As a result, the project has been designed to exceed the minimal requirements, incorporating technologies such as dbt, Airflow, Docker, Apache Spark, and cloud-based storage solutions (BigQuery).
